# BDML/BD5
an open format for representing quantitative data of biological dynamics

## BDML
BDML (Biological Dynamics Markup Language) is an open format for representing quantitative data of biological dynamics. It is based on Extensible Markup Language (XML). BDML covers a wide variety of quantitative data of biological dynamics from molecules to cells to organisms.

## BD5
BD5 supports HDF5-based storage of quantitative data of biological dynamics as the extension of BDML format. This extension enables fast access to quantitative data and practical reuse of the big data of biological dynamics.
